# DelegatingVestingWallet

Make vesting in DAO land work like vesting in startup land, including

- an optional vesting cliff
- the option to accelerate vesting (i.e. instantly vest all tokens)
- the option to revoke unvested tokens
- the ability to vote using unvested tokens (or more specifically, to delegate the tokens to your main account)
- the ability for the beneficiary to sign messages on behalf of the wallet
